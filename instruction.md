Simplified Prompt: OBS Studio Multistream Plugin for Windows 11 (without Qt and CMake)
Objective:
Develop a native OBS Studio plugin tailored exclusively for Windows 11 that enables users to simultaneously stream to multiple RTMP endpoints and multiple YouTube channels.

Technical Stack and Tools:
Operating System: Windows 11 (64-bit)

Programming Language: C++ (OBS Plugin API)

Development Tools:

Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC Compiler)

GUI Integration:

Use standard Win32 UI or minimalistic OBS plugin configuration interface (OBS property pages provided by OBS API).

Skip Qt entirely, leveraging only native Windows or built-in OBS UI elements.

Plugin Functionality:
Multistream Capabilities:

Stream simultaneously to multiple RTMP destinations.

Support multiple simultaneous YouTube live streams.

Allow choosing between:

Shared Encoding: Single stream encoder output replicated across multiple streams.

Separate Encoding (optional): Different settings per stream (resolution, bitrate).

Configuration Interface (Minimalistic):

Provide a simple OBS-integrated configuration interface using OBS’s built-in property dialogs (no custom UI frameworks).

Allow adding, editing, and deleting multiple RTMP/Youtube destinations.

Allow manual entry of RTMP URLs and stream keys.

YouTube Integration (simplified):

No OAuth or direct YouTube API integration required (unless strictly necessary).

User provides YouTube RTMP URLs and stream keys manually.

Architectural Considerations:
Directly utilize OBS’s built-in RTMP output (obs_output_t) and encoder management API.

Synchronize additional RTMP streams with the main OBS streaming lifecycle (events: start/stop).

Implement robust error handling and logging via OBS’s logging API.

Development and Deployment:
No use of CMake. Build exclusively with Visual Studio solution/project files (.sln/.vcxproj).

Output as a standard OBS-compatible DLL plugin (.dll), easily dropped into OBS’s plugin directory.

Provide concise installation and configuration instructions.
